1. .gitignore
2. CSS
3. career pathing
4. Personal Website homework - Github repo

1. I learned how to properly use gitignore. Initially, I thought it was a folder that you add files to that will be ignored. In actuality, the workflow makes more sense through the proper process: make a file called .gitignore, and within that file write various commands like ignore specific file types, ignore files through file paths, and more. 

Ideally, the file to be ignored is created and added to gitignore BEFORE committing the folders containing files including that file. For instance, I had an outdated todo.html file committed and readable on GitHub through the mistaken gitignore folder I had made. I created a new todo.html file which I logged onto .gitignore thus marked as "untracked" by git. Although, I still had the old files on GitHub, so I needed to go on Terminal and prompt "git rm <file with path> then do git commit then git push. 

My .gitignore workflow is 85% there. I want to mark .png files as "untracked". I think I first need to git rm all the files THEN log them onto .gitignore. My brain hurts now tonight so I won't do it now, but at least I've reviewed what I need to do.

2. CSS is cool but I struggle being patient with it. It sucks to toggle back and forth and be nitpicky about every pixel that needs to be modified. But once I do have things set up the way I want them on CSS it's great! 

3. I'm still wondering if I made the right decision to choose Grace Hopper. I wanted to really learn Python, which is taught by Hackbright. Well, it's $3K cheaper than another femme-centered program, Hackbright, and I do enjoy the cohort I am part of. I'm sure I would have equally enjoyed the people I would have met through Hackbright. I really enjoy Grace Hopper because there are more WOC than I would have thought! 

I AM paying for Grace Hopper bootcamp, so I do wish I can take more advantage of the Open Support Hours and schedule a time to meet with the Career Coach. 

I am still struggling with dedicating time on weekends to program. Right now, I only program on days I have class. 

"I decided to join the GH bootcamp to learn a new skill and enhance my marketability, however I am unsure and scared to transition fields especially due to general volatility of the tech industry. I am in a good, stable "golden handcuffs" job (arts admin at a university, entering 6th year) which allows me schedule flexibility and access to various resources. I want to understand what steps to take to be competitive to apply for job desc like the ones I linked (https://careersearch.stanford.edu/jobs/software-engineer-26078). It looks like my bootcamp gears me for web development, but I wish to be proficient in other languages too like Python. Thank you for your time!"

4. I was able to complete the content required for my personal website homework, but I need to review how to use SSH to upload that specific block09 folder to my personal website repository. There is a recorded class video which can help me review how to do it. I was able to successfully do it before. 



# üìì What is a Professional Journal?
Journaling, whether it be personal or professional, is simply keeping track of your experiences, actions, and thoughts. A professional journal is a place to keep memorable notes, solutions to problems, and even future goals. Your journal can be unorganized and random, or structured and streamlined. Ultimately - it has to work for you and fit into your schedule! 

Journaling can be used to reprogram your thoughts into a growth mindset. Use it as a place to track your milestones or process any frustrations. Journaling can be leveraged as a tool for any professional, but is especially beneficial to those seeking a change in their career. 

The tech professional journal for this program is to support your development during your time at Fullstack, as well as throughout your career journey. It is a resource to track your performance and reflect. For example, you can use the journal to describe any of the following:

how you solved a problem
challenges faced
industry interests
project contributions
how you resolved a team conflict
justify reasons for making certain decisions about features
how you plan out 
strengths
how to improve a weakness
workplace values
experiences building your confidence
While this helps you understand yourself as a developer, it can also help you become an effective job candidate for interview questions like, ‚ÄúWhat lesson did you learn working on this project?‚Äù 

 These small day-to-day details can get lost in your memory, and are hard to recall when put on the spot during an interview. By recording and reviewing them regularly, you can better prepare yourself to respond to these questions with meaningful and impactful responses. 

‚ÄºÔ∏è Best Practices
Here are some tips for starting and sticking with professional journaling: 

Start small. You don't have to write a book each day. One or two sentence entries are perfectly acceptable! 
Make it a habit by being consistent. Whether it be at the same time, day, or place - create a habit out of adding to and reviewing your journal. To strengthen commitment, add a calendar reminder or notification to focus.
Feel comfortable using outlines if full sentences don‚Äôt move you. 
Mind map, use short-hand, graphs or images or draw your ideas to help transfer your thoughts.
Don't lie to yourself! Stay candid, no one is reading this but you. 
Include both positives and negatives. 
Reflect on long and short term goals and record any progress made. 
Date all your entries. 
Write without editing or revising. 
Review and re-read your entries. 
Journaling looks different for everyone, so don't be afraid to experiment and make adjustments for what works best for you!  
Use your journal in the following ways: 

Logging those random good ideas that come to you at inconvenient times. 
Noting and reflecting on lessons learned from positive and negative experiences. 
Record advice from mentors you are working with (Career Coaches, Instructors, etc.)
Set goals and plan for the future. 
If attending events or watching content online, use the journal as a source to capture important ideas.
Making note of your contributions on the technical and interpersonal side within your team projects.
